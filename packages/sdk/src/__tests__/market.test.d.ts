 * Tests for SDK market operations — SDK-003
 *
 * Verifies:
 *   - generateTradeLink (positional API in market.ts) produces correct URLs
 *   - generateTradeLinkFromOptions delegates correctly
 *   - getTokenPrice extracts price from getToken response
 *
 * Platform note: 2% trading fee → 100% to protocol treasury (REVENUE_ACCOUNT).
 * There is NO creator fee split. This is enforced by the deployed smart contract.
