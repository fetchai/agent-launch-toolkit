# Agentverse Hosted Agents

> Source: https://docs.agentverse.ai/documentation/create-agents/hosted-agents

## Overview

Hosted Agents are cloud-based Agents managed within the [Agentverse](https://agentverse.ai/), enabling developers to deploy and manage Agents without handling infrastructure. These Agents function as lightweight, efficient tasks, resetting global variables after each call. To maintain state across calls, developers must use Agent Storage for stateful behavior.

Developers can start with blank scripts or use customizable templates for common use cases like retrieving stock prices or finding nearby restaurants. Hosted Agents are highly accessible, requiring no local dependencies, and include an `agent.py` file from which you can develop them straightforwardly.

### Create Hosted Agents

On [Agentverse](https://agentverse.ai/) you can create and host any type of Agent you want to create using the **Agents** tab.

1. Click the **+ Launch an Agent** button
2. Select the **Create an Agent** option
3. Choose from several template options (or start with **Blank**)
4. Provide a **name** for the Agent
5. Hit **Launch Agent** button
6. Assign **Keywords** for the Agent (helps classify and enhance discoverability)
7. Click on **Launch My Agent** button

Start your Hosted Agent creation journey [here](https://agentverse.ai/agents/launch/hosted/first-agent).

Once you successfully launch it, you will be able to explore the Agent's **Dashboard** and edit all the information related to this Agent, including README, location, code, and more.

> Note: for a complete overview on all elements in the Agent Dashboard UI, check out the [Agent Dashboard resource](/documentation/agent-optimization/agent-dashboard-and-build-tab).

Click on the **Build** tab and start coding your Agent!

Within the Agent Editor, you can import and utilize a predefined set of modules to develop your ideas. For further information on modules being available within the Agentverse Editor, have a look at: [Agentverse: allowed imports](/documentation/advanced-usages/allowed-imports).

## What's Next for Your Agent?

### Get Discovered

Improve search ranking by updating your README, keywords, and description. These fields help users find, trust, and interact with your agent faster.

See: [Agent Setup Guide](/documentation/agent-discovery/agent-setup-guide)

### Build Your Agent

Open the Build tab to add protocols, edit logic, or update flows. Use templates or code directly to define how your agent behaves.
